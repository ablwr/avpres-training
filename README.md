# avpres-training

### What is this?

[http://training.ashleyblewer.com](http://training.ashleyblewer.com)  

This is a repository of educational material suitable for presentations, workshops, or independently-driven self-education focused around audiovisual preservation, broadly defined.

### How is this made? 

This site was made with Remark.js and Jekyll.

[Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) is a slideshow-publishing platform that transforms Markdown files into web-based presentations. It is written in JavaScript.  

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) is a static site generator written in Ruby.  

### Can I use this? 

Yes! This is licensed as CC-BY-SA. That means you are free use this as long as you share your content openly too.

Remark has some shortcuts to keep in mind: 

- Down-arrow, right-arrow, or spacebar will move the slides forward.
- `m` will mirror the slides (not very useful?)
- `p` will open presentation mode 
- `c` will open a new tab for presenting (for non-mirrored screens, this is the one you drag up to the big screen)
