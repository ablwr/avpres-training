# File Formats

We have many different types of files! These are categorized into different formats, with different ways to determine what to do with the data inside the file.

---
# Magic numbers

What separates a file from the rest of the binary landscape?
### Magic numbers!
Magic numbers are sometimes known as file signatures. They are a short string of hexadecimal code that  allow a file to identify itself as a certain type of file.

---
# File structure

- Magic numbers (file signature)
- Header
- Body (or payload)

---
# File standardization

- Outlines all the rules required to follow to have a valid file
- Can be standardized through a standards body (but not required)
- Can be open (anyone can read) or closed (proprietary, only people in a company/organization can access)
