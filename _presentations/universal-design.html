# Universal Design

- Universal Design is about making everything accessibile to all people, regardless of age, ability, status, or other factors.
- ‚Äúto enable the widest possible range of users to benefit‚Äù (Shneiderman & Hochheiser, 2001)
- It's about making things **accessible by default**
- Fundamentally, it's about **empathy**

# Principles of Universal Design

1. Equitable Use
2. Flexibility in Use
3. Simple and Intuitive Use
4. Perceptible Information
5. Tolerance for Error
6. Low Physical Effort
7. Size and Space for Approach and Use

Let's step through each of these...

---
# 1. Equitable Use

- 1a. Provide the same means of use for all users: identical whenever possible; equivalent when not.
- 1b. Avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users.
- 1c. Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available to all users.
- 1d. Make the design appealing to all users.

Auto-opening doors (not like these)

# 2. Flexibility in Use

- 2a. Provide choice in methods of use.
- 2b. Accommodate right- or left-handed access and use.
- 2c. Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision.
- 2d. Provide adaptability to the user's pace.

# 3. Simple and Intuitive Use

- 3a. Eliminate unnecessary complexity.
- 3b. Be consistent with user expectations and intuition.
- 3c. Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills.
- 3d. Arrange information consistent with its importance.
- 3e. Provide effective prompting and feedback during and after task completion.

???
Instructions that use visuals instead of written


---
# 4. Perceptible Information

- 4a. Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, tactile) for redundant presentation of essential information.
- 4b. Provide adequate contrast between essential information and its surroundings.
- 4c. Maximize "legibility" of essential information.
- 4d. Differentiate elements in ways that can be described (i.e., make it easy to give instructions or directions).
- 4e. Provide compatibility with a variety of techniques or devices used by people with sensory limitations.

# 5. Tolerance for Error

- 5a. Arrange elements to minimize hazards and errors: most used elements, most accessible; hazardous elements eliminated, isolated, or shielded.
- 5b. Provide warnings of hazards and errors.
- 5c. Provide fail safe features.
- 5d. Discourage unconscious action in tasks that require vigilance.

---
# 6. Low Physical Effort

- 6a. Allow user to maintain a neutral body position.
- 6b. Use reasonable operating forces.
- 6c. Minimize repetitive actions.
- 6d. Minimize sustained physical effort.

# Other examples

There are endless other examples of how designs can be good or bad for everybody.

[U of Buffalo Digital Collections](http://digital.lib.buffalo.edu/collection/SAP001/) provide another collection of products focused on Universal Design.

# Digital world

A lot of these examples are based in the physical world, but this applies to the digital world too. How can websites be designed in a way that allow for better access for everybody, and inclusive of everybody?

[This web style guide](https://www.webstyleguide.com/wsg3/2-universal-usability/3-universal-design.html) provides examples of the Universal Design principles and how they can be used in the digital content space.
