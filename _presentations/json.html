# JSON

(work in progress)

.center[![under-construction]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/under-construction.gif)]

---
# JSON

- "JavaScript Object Notation"
- a way to exchange informations (computers talking to computers)
- a standard, which means it has a [written specification](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) and rules for how it works.
- related to javascript but doesn't have to be used only with javascript

---
# Example

```
{
  "firstName": "Ashley",
  "lastName": "Blewer",
  "isAlive": true,
  "age": 100,
  "address": {
    "streetAddress": "123 Main Street",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": "11111"
  },
  "phoneNumbers": [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "555 555-1234"
    },
    {
      "type": "mobile",
      "number": "123 456-7890"
    }
  ]
}
```

# Data types

- numbers (e.g. 1)
- strings (e.g. "Hello")
- booleans (e.g. `true`)
- no value (e.g. `null`)

---
# Data structures

- elements in curly braces! (`{` and `}`)
- arrays (things inside of `[` and `]`)
- objects ("key": "value" pairs)

---
# Other bits to notice

- String literals (e.g. "\"Phrase in Double Quotes, inside of Quotes\"")
- Quotation marks = strings
- Booleans are not wrapped in quotation marks
- Elements can repeat but you must use a comma

`{ "a":123, "b":[1,2,3], "c": { "a":1, "b":2 } }`
