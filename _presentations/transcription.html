- Title III, which deals with public accommodation of people with disabilities.

# Closed captioning

Closed captioning is the display of text on television. The "closed" part indicates that they are not permanently "burned" onto the screen for display, but rather have to be activated by the viewer through an assisted device or adjustment of default settings.
