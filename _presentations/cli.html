# Command Line Interface

# What is Command Line Interface?

A **terminal window** is a text-only window in a **graphical user interface** (GUI) that emulates a console.

A GUI is a type of human-computer interface (i.e., a system for people to interact with a computer) that uses windows, icons, pull-down menus and a pointer and that can be manipulated by a mouse (and usually to some extent by a keyboard as well). 

A **command** is an instruction telling a computer to do something, such as launch a program.

A **command line interface** (CLI) is an all-text display mode that has a command interpreter running in it and that shows commands, including their arguments, and other data as they are typed in at the keyboard as well as the results of most such commands. 

A command interpreter, also referred to as a **shell**, is a program whose primary function is to read commands that are typed into a console or terminal window and then execute (i.e., run) them.

# A note about directories

Directory is another word for what the GUI represents as a "folder."

# Let's practice some commands! 

---
# Show current directory

## Mac/Linux: `pwd`

## Windows: `ch` or `chdir`

---
# Change current directory

## Mac/Linux: `cd` /Path/to/change/to

## Windows: `cd` \Path\to\change\to

`..` will take you "up" one level.

---
# List **this** directory's contents

## Mac/Linux: `ls`

## Windows: `dir`

---
# List **that** directory's contents

## Mac/Linux: `ls path/to/directory`

## Windows: `dir path\to\directory`

Hint: You can drag and drop a folder into the CLI window.

---
# See all files, subfolder and files in subfolders

## Mac/Linux: `tree`

## Windows: `tree /f`

---
# Create a file 

## Mac/Linux: `touch example.txt`

## Windows: ü§î `New-Item -ItemType file example.txt`


---
# Create a directory

## Mac/Linux: `mkdir name-of-directory`

## Windows: `mkdir name-of-directory`

---
# Copy a file

## Mac/Linux:  
## `cp name-of-file.txt name-of-copy.txt`

## Windows:  
## `copy name-of-file.txt name-of-copy.txt`

---
# Move or rename a file

## Mac/Linux:
## `mv name-of-file.txt new-name.txt`

## Windows:
## `move name-of-file.txt new-name.txt`
## `ren name-of-file.txt new-name.txt`

---
# A note about deleting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è It's dangerous! ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è  

When you delete something on the command line, it deletes it instantly and forever. It does not put it in the Recycle Bin or Trash.

---
# Removing empty directories

## Mac/Linux: `rmdir name-of-directory`

## Windows: `rmdir name-of-directory`

if you try to remove a non-empty directory with `rmdir`, you will get an error

---
# Removing files

## Mac/Linux: `rm name-of-file.txt`

## Windows: `rm name-of-file.txt`
