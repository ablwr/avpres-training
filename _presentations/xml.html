# XML

XML is a means of sharing data between computers. It can be read and understood
by humans, but its primary purpose is to be a way of exchanging information
between computers or systems.

By doing this in a structured, standardized way, it allows for data to be
passed from one system to the other without any ambiguity. 

If you think of the game "Telephone" where people pass a message between each
other through whispering, it is easy to have that original message distorted
somewhere along the way. XML is a way to prevent data distortion.

# XML

XML is a relative of HTML

- XML is **extensible**: it does not consist of a fixed (limited) set of tags
- XML must be **well-formed** according to a defined specification
- XML documents can be **validated** against a specific schema (not just one global schema)
- XML is about the data (its contents) and not about how that data is presented

---
# XML structure

- XML must have a **declaration**
- XML can have **namespaces**
- XML has **elements**
- XML can have **attributes**
---

---
# Namespaces

.center[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ns.png)]

---
# Document declaration

`
<?xml version="1.0" ?>`

This is to let the software reading an XML file that you are going to present it
with XML. Computers don't always trust the file extension or other indicators
that a document is what it says it is. This says "I have prepared this XML, and
this declaration at the top of the file lets you know that XML is coming through
next."

# Simple Example

```
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<books>
  <book>
    <title>My Father's Dragon</title>
    <author>Ruth Stiles Gannett</author>
    <subjects>
      <subject>Children's</subject>
    </subjects>
  </book>
</books>
```

---
# Example with attributes

```
<movies>
  <movie id="3">
    <title language="french">Jeanne Dielman, 23, Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles</title>
    <director nationality="belgian">Chantal Akerman</director>
  </movie>
</movies>
```

# Where else can you find XML?

XML as a way to exchange data is the foundation of several well-known file
formats:

- SVG files
- PDF files
- Microsoft Office files (.docx, .xlsx, and .pptx)
