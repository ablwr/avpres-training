There are many different ways to do things with CSS. While HTML is more inclined to follow the best semantic practice, CSS is much more open to interpretation. This can be frustrating because there's less of a "right way" to do something.

# How to put CSS on the page

Something like this goes between your HTML `<head>` tags:

# `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`

---
# CSS works on

- HTML elements
- HTML elements with a specific *class* attribute
- HTML elements with a specific *ID* attribute

---
# Basic syntax

```css
h1 {
	color: red;
}

.red {
	color: red;
}

#red {
	color: red;
}
```
---
# Basic syntax

```html
<h1>This header</h1>
<h1 class="red">This header</h1>
<h1 id="red">This header</h1>
```

---
# Basic syntax

- `h1` is the *selector*
- `{` and `}` hold the rules (called *declarations*)
- `color` is the property
- `red` is the value
- the semi-colon ends the declaration, and a new one can begin

---
# Multiple declarations

```css
h1 {
	color: red;
	font-weight: bold;
}
```

---
# Multiple selectors

```css
h1, h2 {
	color: red;
}
```

---
# Competing declarations

```css
h1 {
	color: red;
	color: pink;
}

h1 {
	color: blue;
}
```

---
# Children selectors

```css
#red > p {
	color: red
}
```

(Every paragraph tag nested inside of an element with an ID of "red")

---
# Adjacent selectors

```css
h1 + p {
  color: red;	
}
```

(The paragraph tag that comes right after the h1 tag, and no others)

---
# HTML attributes with a certain value

```css
input[type=text] {
	border: 1px solid red;
}
```

(HTML forms that are text will have a red border)

---
# `!important`

```css
h1 {
	color: red !important;
}

h1 {
	color: blue;
}
```

This is not really "good practice" but it's good in an emergency

---
# Comments in CSS

```css
/* this is a comment */
```

---
# Changing text

- `font-family` (serif, san serif, or names -- see next slide)
- `font-size` (make big or small -- see a few slides from now)
- `font-weight` (boldness or lack of)
- `font-style` (italic or lack of)
- `text-transform` (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize)

---
# Changing fonts

- Fonts are special; they are loaded from your computer
- Computers don't always have the same fonts
- Let's look at ["web-safe fonts"](https://www.cssfontstack.com/) 
- Fonts can also be embedded, using something like [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

---
# Changing fonts

- Here's how to do it: `h1 {font-family: "Open Sans", Verdana, sans serif;}`
- Note that you can "stack" fonts in this way
- The first is a two-word font name, the second is a font name on many computers, and the last is a general font style

---
# Sizing things

There are a lot of options:

- pixels (`width: 800px`)
- frames (`width: 1fr`)
- vertical width / vertical height (`width: 10vw`)
- percentage (`width: 80%`)

---
# Making space

- Everything on the web is a bunch of boxes even if it doesn't look like it
- padding (add space around element)
- border (add space around padding)
- margin (add space around border)

<div style="padding:40px;border: 20px solid black; margin:40px;">Box example</div>

---
# Lets talk about color

- üåàüåàüåà
- Here's a list of the 140 named colors: [htmlcolorcodes.com](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/)
- "color" means changing the attribute's foreground color (e.g. text, border)
- `background-color` will change the color of the box area
---
# Color: lots of options

- `red`
- `rgb(255,0,0)`
- `rgb(100%,0%,0%)`
- `#ff0000`
- `#f00`
- `hsl(0,100,50)`

You can also add transparency to RGB or HSL values:
- `rgba(255,0,0,0.5)`
- `hsla(0,100,50, 0.5)`
