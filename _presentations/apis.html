# Computers talking to computers

So APIs are all about computers talking to computers, but they're also an
*abstraction layer* that allows people to easily understand how to get the data
that they need from a computer.

When you query an API (asking it to give you some data), it will always return
data in a specific format. The data itself might change, but the arrangement of
the data will always be the same.

This game was made possible by Philadelphia Museum of Art's [public
API](https://hackathon.philamuseum.org/) for providing images.

In case the API goes down, the game looks something like this:
