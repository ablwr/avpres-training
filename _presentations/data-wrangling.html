# Data Wrangling

- extraction (get data out of something)
- scraping (get some data from a source)
- preparation (change data to fit into a system or process)
- cleaning (tidy up the data)
- joining (pairing data points)
- integrating (combining data sets)
- deduplicating (removing extra same data)
- bulk editing (change data)
- manipulation (modify the data)
- transformation (turn data into something else)
- curation (refine data)
- arrangement (putting data in order)
- storage (putting data somewhere)
- validation (making sure the data is correct)
- visualizing (representing data in visual way)

# Data wrangling 

Data wrangling can be:
- manual 
- automated 
- semi-automated 

and done: 

- once 
- a few times 
- regularly scheduled

# Tools 

- Multi-cursor
- OpenRefine
- MarcEdit
- Pandoc 
- XSLT
- Scripting
- Libraries
- Jupyter 
- R 
- Visualization

# Multi-cursor 

I get away with a lot of bulk data manipulation operations by utilizing the multi-cursor feature of a text editing program. This can also be understood as "strategic find-and-replace." 

For example, I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) for a text editor. You can create multiple cursors by... 

- holding `cmd` while clicking elsewhere in the doc,
- `cmd + d` to grab matching strings of text like what you have highlighted currently, or 
- `ctrl + shift + arrowkey` to grab adjacent lines!

# OpenRefine 

OpenRefine defines itself as "a powerful tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with web services and external data."

Website: [http://openrefine.org/](http://openrefine.org/)

Library Carpentry offers a good workshop on OpenRefine, so I won't repeat work and just link to it:

[https://data-lessons.github.io/library-openrefine/](https://data-lessons.github.io/library-openrefine/)

# MarcEdit 

MarcEdit is a metadata editing software suite used primarily to create and manipulate MARC records.

Website: [http://marcedit.reeset.net/](http://marcedit.reeset.net/)

Official tutorials are available: [http://marcedit.reeset.net/tutorials](http://marcedit.reeset.net/tutorials)

---
# Pandoc 

Pandoc is a powerful, open source command line document conversion tool.  

For example, it can translate docx files into html, html into markdown, or text into pdf.   

Example command: `pandoc -o output.html input.txt`

# SPARQL 

SPARQL is a language used for querying RDF-based databases. 

[https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/)

Demo/practice here: [http://www.sparql.org/query.html](http://www.sparql.org/query.html) (but seems to be down, so maybe not)  

Demo/practice HERE!: [http://dbpedia.org/isparql/](http://dbpedia.org/isparql/)

# XSLT 

There's a whole deck dedicated to XSLT! 

XSLT is a *transformation language* for changing XML into other kinds of XML (usually).

[Go here]({{ site.baseurl }}/presentations/xslt.html)

---
# Scripting 

Like XSLT, general-use programming languages can be used to create scripts that transform similar data or one very large dataset for you.

Example: [XML into CSV using Ruby](http://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2016/09/21/lorena-parsing-xml-into-csv-with-ruby/)

---
# Libraries

Programming languages don't have to be used alone -- you can rely on libraries (a collection of methods that allow you to easily do a general task instead of having to write all of the code from scratch by yourself).

---
# Libraries in Python 

- ElementTree: [here](http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2013/04/30/python-101-intro-to-xml-parsing-with-elementtree/)'s a blog post on how to use this 
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/): for computing scientific data
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): a data analysis library 
- [xmltodict](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict): good to try if familiar with JSON manipulation but are working with XML

---
# Libraries in Ruby 

Python really is a leader in this space, but I like Ruby (and a lot of #GLAM web apps run on Rails)

- [daru](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru): data manipulation in Ruby (inspired by pandas)
- [Nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org/): for XML, HTML, web-scraping, and other things

# Jupyter 

"Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages."

[https://jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org)

## The Jupyter Notebook

"The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more."

[Tutorials](https://jupyter.org/try)

---
# R 

R is a language used for statistical computation. It's good for creating data visualizations for reports.


[https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/)

A helpful library to use with R is [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

---
# Visualization

Now that data has been wrangled, how can you represent it? 

- [Charted](https://www.charted.co/): Drop in a spreadsheet and see results
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org): Javascript library for manipulating HTML and SVG
- [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/): for visualizing map data 
- [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/): Javascript general-use visualization library
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/): a simpler, easier version of Processing
- [Sheetsee.js](http://jlord.us/sheetsee.js/): Visualize spreadsheets on the web
