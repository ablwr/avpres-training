# Codecs

A codec encodes and decodes a data stream or a signal for transmission and storage. Within the context of video, that data stream can be video or audio.

# Some popular codecs (audio)

You'll see some repeats from the containers section. 

- AAC 
- FLAC 
- PCM (Uncompressed)
- MP3 
- Ogg 
- Opus

# Note on containers/wrappers

Sometimes the wrapper and the codec have the same name. Sometimes it's because they can only be used with each other.

For example, the Windows Media Player container can only contain the Windows Media Player codec. They are tied together in that way.

# Techniques 

Two principal techniques are used in codecs, pulse-code modulation and delta modulation.

Pulse code modulation (PCM) digitally represents sampled analog signals.

Delta modulation builds on PCM but adds some functionalities based on the prediction of the samples of the signal.

---
# Uncompressed, compression 

"Uncompressed" data is still a codec because there are rules around the streams of data, including information like chroma subsampling choice, colorspace data, etc. Uncompressed is different from raw data.

---
# Uncompressed 

```
D.VI.S 012v                 Uncompressed 4:2:2 10-bit

# Lossy, lossless compression 

Compression makes files smaller but does not necessarily mean that the files will lose data, so codecs are described as being either lossless or lossy. Lossy means the original stream of data, after encoding, cannot be decoded back to its original state. Lossless compression means that the encoding process is reversible and the data can be returned to the same state as prior to encoding/compression. 

A higher-level analogy to this compressing a PDF into a .zip file for storage or transfer. When the file is unzipped, it is the same as it was before it was zipped. This is the same concept for other forms of compression, like video. This is lossless compression.

---
# Open, closed formats

Codecs that offer lossless compression and are open formats are safe to use for preservation because the information for decoding that data and bringing it back to its original state is available. 

---
# Perceptually lossless

Perceptually lossless is not the same as being as lossless encoding, but rather a codec that asserts itself as being so good at encoding that the image is not able to be identified as lossless by the human eye.

---
# Codec profile

Codecs don't necessary inform video quality, as some codecs can have profiles that modify the algorithm to compress more tightly (for smaller file size) or prioritize quality (with bigger file size), among other things.

For example, h.264 as a codec can mean wildly different things based on the profile applied when encoding. h.264 refers to the algorithm used to compress media, but that algorithm can be tweaked. h.264's Baseline Profile will be more lossy but a smaller filesize and more appropriate for streaming media, while its High 4:4:4 Predictive Profile (Hi444PP) supportsup to 4:4:4 chroma sampling, up to 14 bits per sample, and additionally supporting efficient lossless region coding and the coding of each picture as three separate color planes.

---
# Codec profile example

via `mediainfo -f`:

```
Codec profile                            : High@L2.1
Codec settings                           : CABAC / 4 Ref Frames
Codec settings, CABAC                    : Yes
Codec_Settings_RefFrames                 : 4
```
